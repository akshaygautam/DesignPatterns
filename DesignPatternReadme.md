# Design Pattern
## A Pattern is a solution to a problem in context.
	> The Context is the situation in which the pattern applies. This should be a recurring situation.
	> The Problem refers to the goal you are trying to achieve in this context, but it also refers to any constraints that occur in the context.
	> The solution is what you're after: A general design that anyone can apply which resolves the goal and set of constraints.
	
###  If you find yourself in a context with a problem that has a goal that is effected by a set of constraints, then you can apply a design that resolves the goal and constraints and lead to a solution.
