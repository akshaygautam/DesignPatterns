# Proxy Pattern
## The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- A remote proxy controls the access to a remote object
- A virtual proxy controls access to create a resource that is expensive to create.
- A protection proxy controls access to a resource based on access rights.
