# Strategy Pattern
The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one,
and makes them interchangeable, Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently
from client that uses it.

## Design principles
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same
- Program to an Interface, not implementations 
> the word interface is overloaded here, the concept interface, JAVA construct Interface 
You can program to an interface without having to actually use java interface
- Favor composition over inheritance i.e prefer HAS-A over IS-A
