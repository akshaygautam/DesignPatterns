# Singleton Pattern
##Ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

- The singleton pattern ensures you have at most one instance of a class in your application.
- The singleton also provides global access point to that instance.
- Java's implementation on singleton pattern makes use of private constructor, a static method combined with a static variable
- Using multiple class loaders can break singleton.
