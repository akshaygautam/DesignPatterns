# Design patterns.
## Refering Head first design pattern.
### The golden rules of using pattern:

> Center your thinking on design, not on patterns. Use patterns when there is a natural need for them. 
    If something simpler will work, then use it.
> Pattern are a tool, and a tool should only be used when needed. 
    Always start from principles and create the simplest code you can that does the job.
> Introduce a pattern when you're sure it is necessary to solve a problem in your design, 
    or when you are quiet sure that it is needed to deal with a future change in the reuirements of your application.
> Patterns can introduce complexity,  and we never want complexity where it is not needed. 
    But patterns are powerful when used when they're needed.

## Anti-patterns
### An anti-pattern tells you how to go from a problem to a BAD solution.
> An anti-pattern tells you why a bad solution is attractive.
> An anti-pattern tells you why that solution in the long term is bad.
> An anti-pattern suggests other patterns that are applicable which may provide good solution.
