# State Pattern
## The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This object will appear to change its class.

### The pattern encapsulates state into separate classes and delegates to the object representing the current state.
### If an object you're using can completely change its behavior, then it appears to you that the object is actually instantiated from another class.
