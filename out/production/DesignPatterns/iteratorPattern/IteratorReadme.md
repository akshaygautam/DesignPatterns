# Iterator pattern
## The Iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

### It also places the task of traversal on the iterator iterator object,not on the aggregate, which simplifies the aggregate interface and place the responsibility where it should be. 

# Design principle
	> A class should have only one reason to change.
	- Every responsibility of a class is an area of potential change. More than one responsibility means more than one reason to change.
	- This principle guides use to keep each class to a single responsibility.
